https://www.fortinet.com/fr/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-site-to-site-vpn <br><br>

**Definition**
- Site-to-site VPN:  a connection set up between multiple networks. <br><br>
### **Types of VPN's**
- Remote Access VPN:  "a temporary connection between two or more users and a central location." 
- Intranet-based Site-to-Site VPN:  a connection between "more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN)."
- Extranet-based Site-to-Site VPN:  two or more sites or companies that share resources while keeping other resources private. <br><br>
### Key Components of Site-to-Site VPN
1. strong security
2. ease of use
3. scalable while staying simple and secure
4. business continuity (should there be an infrastructure issue)
5. flexible deployment<br><br><br><br>
*I've used VPN tunneling at multiple job sites for the purpose of segregating client information and files from the general internet and from the guest wifi network.  The VPN tunnel was also used for remote access to the client file system, in the event someone had to work from outside of the office for a time.*<br><br><br>
