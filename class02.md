### What is a Domain?

Windows domains are used on large networks, usually corporate. 
- settings and user accounts are controlled by the domain controller. 
	- domain controllers are made up of one or more servers
		- provide network admins ability to manage large number of pc's on the same network, or remotely via VPN from one place.  
		- group policy settings, implementation.

- local user accounts are not used on the pc's.
- domain login usable on any machine on domain. 

- How to check if computer part of a domain:
	- control panel, system, security, system
		computer name, domain, workgroup settings
		if word "domain" is followed by a domain name, yes. 
		if "workgroup" followed by name, pc is part of workgroup, not domain. 

### Workgroups 
- if pc not part of a domain = part of workgroup
- refers to computers on same local network
- no computer has control over any other in group.

### Joining or Leaving a Domain
- need permission from administrator, or be the local admin. 
- Settings, sys info, sys properties
	- can do so here if part of domain and have access to change this
- Can reinstall windows if part of old domain no longer applicable.
