https://www.howtogeek.com/443161/what-is-patch-tuesday-for-windows-and-when-is-it/

### - **Patch Tuesday** = when Microsoft releases large update packages for the OS (10 and 7) and other MS software.<br><br>
- Does not contain new features
- "B updates" (means released second week of month)
- security updates
- predictable schedule for sys admin convenience
- Second Tuesday of each month (in North America) around 10am<br><br>
### Out of band updates = for critical security flaws
- these do not happen on a schedule)<br><br>

- C and D updates = third and fourth week of each month
	- optional
	- for bug fixes, improvements that aren't security holes
	- after testing, they go into the next month's B update)<br><br>

- Big Updates to Windows 10/11 = every 6 months
	- not automatically installed on user's PC until possibly months later
		- MS uses AI to determine the update is safe for user's combo of hardware and software
		- MS recommends waiting to install until no longer optional<br><br>
