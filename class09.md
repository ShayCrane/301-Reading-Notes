## CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes
https://medium.com/@ethicalentrepreneur/cidr-block-notation-explained-in-2-minutes-1010ec0dbc15 <br><br><br><br>


**CIDR block = range of IP addresses**
**CIDR notation = way of representing that range**<br><br>

*When creating a network: there must be enough available IP addresses within the range while making sure the block is not too large.*<br><br>

The structure of IPv4 is: 
- four 8-bit decimal #'s 
	- called *octets*
	- has range = 0-255
	- in total = 32 bits<br><br>
		- range of 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 
		- ^^^ **this is the CIDR block**<br><br>

		- that range is represented as 0.0.0.0/0 (somehow)
		- ^^^ **this is CIDR notation**<br><br><br><br>


## What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters
https://www.comptia.org/blog/security-awareness-training-network-segmentation

***"Network segmentation is when different parts of a computer network, or network zones, are separated by devices like bridges, switches and routers."***
- Segmentation isolates a network's systems and services 
	- this prevents a malicious attack from accessing more on the network than just the targeted system/service
	- removes convenience for potential attackers/limits access privilege<br><br>

**Types of Network Segmentation**
1.  Users
2.  Screened Subnet
3.  Guest Network
4.  IT Workstations  
5.  Servers by Department
6.  VoIP/Comm's
7.  Traditional Physical Security
8.  Industrial Control Systems
9.  Customer Databases
