Re: Windows Server


# What's the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?


Although the two Windows builds share similar code, GUI, and use the same kernel, that's all they have in common. 

## What sets Windows Server apart from Windows Desktop?

- Purpose: manage other computers, provide file server or web server. 
	
- It's recommended to use Windows Server without its GUI to maximize the server's resources.  

- the access to Windows Deployment services
- DHCP services
- Active Directory Domain Services: control of network domain for joining other computers to the domain/ create domain users. 

- SMB Direct: efficient file sharing, Resilient File System 

- The above features can be split up among more than one server on the network.  

- Supports Higher-End Hardware:
	- allows for 24 TB of RAM!
	- supports two CPU's
	- no limit for core support

	- Extra security: uses IE in a limited way by default (but exceptions can be made, though tedious bc this is not what it's made for).

- no sign-in with MS account. 
	- instead: sign in with local account or domain account. 
- More expensive: Windows license = $500-$6200. 

### Things I want to learn more about: 
- I want to be able set up a network in a way that is so innovative and concise that it gives me a (good) professional reputation among experienced network specialists/architects. No one has idea how much I like getting things to connect and work with each other.  Ask me about how I set up my small space automatic washing machine and dryer in a century-old apartment building...
